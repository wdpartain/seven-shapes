Deliverables
============

This is a list of the *very first* things that should be done (probably).

(See also: [goals (and non-goals)](goals-and-non-goals.md))

1.  A plausible-if-vague definition of [data types](data-types.md) in the system.

2.  A plausible-if-vague definition of [data formats](data-formats.md)
in which data will be stored.

3.  Some simple examples of data files...

4.  ... perhaps creating by converting existing singing data.  (Being able to represent what already exists is a good start.)

(I realize this will leave Very Hard Problems still on the table.)
