Privacy concerns
================

We would like to store information about singers, but that can be
problematic in the information age.

There is a balance to be struck: It's crazy not to list someone's
name, while their web browser is spewing out megabytes of quite
personal information (back to Google, Facebook, etc.) every hour.

Recording singers' names has happened "forever" and has stood the test
of time.  So we'll do that.

I would like to record where living singers are "from" and, for those
who have died, their birth/death/burial/obituary details.  This
shouldn't be a problem ("JUST TYPE YOUR NAME INTO FAMILYSEARCH.ORG,
OK?") but it is perhaps best to err on the side of caution.

Actually, I would also like to record family relationships, so that
"singing families" can be traced.  They are an important part of the
tradition, albeit less so than in the past.

A possible solution is: Record all this information *off* the public
internet and make available a (machine-generated) version that can be
used with the public singing data.  Interested parties could get a
copy of the "real" data by other means.
