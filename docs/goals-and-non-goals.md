Goals (and non-goals) of the seven-shapes project
=================================================

(See also: [deliverables](deliverables.md))

Goals
-----

We hope to collect [a] minutes (as commonly understood) of singings
from seven-shape dispersed-harmony tunebooks, of which the *Christian
Harmony* is a prominent example; and [b] associated data about
singings, singers, tunebooks, etc.

This data will be saved in *easily machine-manipulable* forms,
e.g. ordinary CSV files, that will be accessible for *many decades* to
come.  We will aim for "archive quality", but this may need to be
tempered by reality, i.e. if we're too fussy about what people must
submit, they won't.

We hope to collect data both for current/ongoing singings, but also
historical data for singings that happened in the past.

We aim to define *simple formats* to record minutes (and other)
information, and modest *tools* to process and/or check submitted
materials.

It would be great to share formats/tools/etc with other people doing
similar things, e.g. the Sacred Harp people.

Non-goals
---------

There is no intention of producing anything "user-facing" that makes
use of the singings data.

I have no plans to collect audio or video from singings, and I'm not
sure about photographs/scans either.

That said, a sister project (seven-shapes-media?) probably needs to
exist.  For example, if we've extracted minutes from scans of old
documents, we should be hanging on to the scans.
