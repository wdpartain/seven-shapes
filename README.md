[This "project" is in a pre-due-diligence phase, i.e. "Has it already
been done?"  "Does it makes sense?"  "Would anyone care?" etc.]

This project aims to create a repository of the minutes of singings
from seven-shape dispersed-harmony tunebooks (*Christian Harmony* is a
notable example).

The assembled material should be easily machine-manipulable, good for
the long term (many decades) and of archive quality.

The project will need lots of help, especially in collecting the
minutes and assembling them into the right format(s).
